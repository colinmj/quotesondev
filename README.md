## Quotes On Dev 

I've replicated the designers vision for 'Quotes on Dev'- a site inspired by Chris Coyier's "Quotes on Design". Quotes on Dev uses a custom Rest Api to randomly fetch a different post when the 'Show me another' button is clicked.

## Getting Started

The home page displays a quote and a button that one can click to generate another random quote. Pressing this button initiates an ajax request to the rest api to display a new quote from the quotes stored in the blog posts section of the site. There is an About page, and Archives page that has direct links to the different authors, categories and tags, and there is a submit page. If the user is logged in they can submit a new quote via an ajax post request.

## Learning 

This was my first experience working with a custom api, and using ajax with wordpress. As it's only my second wordpress site, I'm still learning about the template hierarchy and all the built in wordpress methods. This was also my first ajax post request.
